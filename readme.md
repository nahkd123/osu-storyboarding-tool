# osu! Storyboarding tool #
I made this tool, just because the default storyboarding tool from osu! is hard to use (not really, but
you're limited to only 4 layers)

## Requirements ##
 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - NPM (it should be included with NodeJS. If not, you can install it by using ``sudo apt install npm``)

## How to use? ##
Simply type ``npm run test`` in terminal/command prompt. I also created a simple batch file for Windows
user. Simply double-click ``start_server.bat``, and you'll have a running server

The tool is hosted in port 8080, and the HTML page is /html/index.html. That mean you need to go to URL 
``http://localhost:8080/html/index.html``
